<p>If you do this</p>
<p><code>sysuse auto<br />
sum price, detail<br />
return list<br />
</code></p>
<p>you will see that Stata saves summary statistics in a few scalars with some rather apt names, like r(N) for count, r(mean) for mean, or r(p99) for the 99th percentile.</p>
<p>Those names used to be far less descriptive until a few years back. If you come across code written by people who learned their Stata prior to version 6 or so, you're bound to see things like _result(1) rather than r(N). For a full listing of the old-school names, do this after you've ran the code above:</p>
<p><code>forvalues i=1/20 {<br />
di "_result(`i') is "_result(`i')<br />
}</code></p>
<p>There are only 18 _result()-style results, but I couldn't remember the exact number. 20 was my first guess, based on the eyeballed length of the <code>return list</code> output. Stata doesn't mind if you overshoot the loop size. It will just return missing scalars as, well, missing.</p>
