<p>R objects come with various methods that make them useful. I tend to stumble over these by googling something I want to do, and finding some code example on StackOverflow. But today I learned (from <a href="https://twitter.com/RLangTip">@RLangTip</a>) that there is a straightforward way to list them all: you simply call e.g., <code>methods(class='lm')</code>.</p>
<p>That's nice, but mileage varies and I don't have a good explanation for it. Take <a href="http://gking.harvard.edu/zelig">Zelig</a> for example. It has this <code>sim()</code> function which produces a simulation object with some methods of its own. One of these is <code>plot.ci()</code>, illustrated <a href="http://rpubs.com/ghuiber/zelig">here</a>. Unfortunately, you won't find it with the <code>methods()</code> call:</p>

Attaching package: ‘Zelig’

The following object is masked from ‘package:utils’:

    cite

> methods(class='sim')
[1] plot.sim*   print.sim*   repl.sim*   simulation.matrix.sim*
[5] summary.sim           

   Non-visible functions are asterisked
</code></pre>
<p>See that? There's a non-visible <code>plot()</code> method listed, but no <code>plot.ci()</code> method, yet it exists and it works. I wonder why that is. Is it maybe that <code>plot.ci()</code> is some kind of child of <code>plot()</code>? If so, how do you list such children?</p>
