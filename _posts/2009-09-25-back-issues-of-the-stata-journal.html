<p>I have this <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=Stata++-%22Stata+-center%22+-%22%C3%A8+-stata%22+-%22Ray+-Stata%22+-%22Stata+-Labs%22">Twitter search</a> saved in my Google Reader. It works OK. One recent tweet by DismalTrader linked to an old Stata Journal article about demand estimation,Â saved on Scribd. This reminded me that <a href="http://www.stata-journal.com">The Stata Journal</a> has a three-year moving wall: anything older than three years prior to the latest issue is available free, in beautiful PDF. The article I'm talking about, for example, is <a href="http://www.stata-journal.com/article.html?article=st0029">here</a>. One of these days I'll make time to feature at least one such article every week. Until then, bookmark the thing and go poke around. There's a lot of good stuff in those back issues.</p>
