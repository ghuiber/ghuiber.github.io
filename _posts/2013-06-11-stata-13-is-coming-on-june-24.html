<p>Yellow color scheme is out, sky-blue is in, plus expanded capabilities, as one might expect. Notable among them, <code>xtologit</code>, <code>xtoprobit</code> and long strings -- 2 billion character long, that is. One of these days you won't need an RDBMS anymore. Wouldn't that be nice?</p>
<p>See more details <a href="http://www.stata.com/stata13/">here</a>.</p>
