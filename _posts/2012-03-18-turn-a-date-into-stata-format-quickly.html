<p>There's a little program that's shown up more than once now in my housekeeping do-files,  so it may be useful enough for a blog post, but it doesn't quite warrant a spot in <code>c(sysdir_personal)</code> as a stand-alone ado-file. Here:</p>
<pre><code>
// turn this date to Stata format
// if it's not that way already
capture prog drop setStataDate
program setStataDate

args v fmt // fmt can be MDY or YMD

tempname x
capture confirm string variable `v'
if _rc==0 {
   local l`v' : variable label `v'
   gen `x'=date(`v',"`fmt'")
   format `x' %td
   drop `v'
   rename `x' `v'
   label variable `v' "`l`v''"
   // order `v'
}

end
</code></pre>
<p>I use it with data sets derived from merging other data sets. It's useful if in the original data sets there are string dates in mixed formats -- maybe YYYY-MM-DD in the "master", and MM/DD/YYYY in the "using" -- or if these string dates have labels I want to keep. So, you see why it's not clear that this is worth an ado-file. I don't want to type all the code between the curlies more than once, but usually I don't have to. </p>
<p>I do want to be able to call this program by name, as in <code>setStataDate somedate MDY</code> from within another program, then forget about it, safe in the knowledge that it won't make any difference if <em>somedate</em> is already in Stata format. That's the job of the if-condition you see there, and this is all this little program does.</p>
<p>As to the reason for using the temporary name x, see the comment thread. Temporary names for variables generated only to be renamed are the safe option. The alternative is to use a one-letter convenience name, like x, and I did that first. But what if you want to use this program with a data set that includes a variable named x already?</p>
