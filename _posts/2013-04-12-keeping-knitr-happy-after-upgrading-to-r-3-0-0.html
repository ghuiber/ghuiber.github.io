<p>As noted <a href="http://www.r-bloggers.com/r-3-0-0-is-released-whats-new-and-how-to-upgrade/">here</a>, after upgrading to R 3.0.0 you must run </p>
<pre><code>
update.packages(checkBuilt=TRUE)
</code></pre>
<p>This is because a bunch of packages have to be to rebuilt under R 3.0.0 in order to keep working. </p>
<p>So I did, but that was not enough for <a href="http://www.lyx.org/">LyX</a> to be able to compile my pdf's from <a href="http://yihui.name/knitr/">knitr</a> like it used to only a week ago. What I had to do besides was this:</p>
<pre><code>
remove.packages("tikzDevice")
install.packages("/Users/ghuiber/Downloads/tikzDevice_0.6.3.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type="source")
</code></pre>
<p>That is right. The package <code>tikzDevice</code> can no longer be installed directly from R-forge as a binary, as in<br />
<code>
<pre>
install.packages("tikzDevice", repos="http://R-Forge.R-project.org")
</pre>
<p></code><br />
Also, the source files are only available as a .tar.gz archive. To install from it on a Windows machine, you must have <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/">Rtools</a> installed first.</p>
