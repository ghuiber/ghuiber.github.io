<p>The quick version of this post goes like this:<br />
-- # in Stata is : in R<br />
-- ## in Stata is * in R.</p>
<p>The long version is that both Stata and R handle very nicely factor variables in regression models. If you want a full-factorial interaction between a factor variable x1 and a continuous variable x2, the Stata way is to say</p>
<pre><code>
regress y i.x1##c.x2
</code></pre>
<p>whereas the R way is to say</p>
<pre><code>
lm(y~factor(x1)*x2)
</code></pre>
<p>Now, if you just want to interact x1 with the slope of x2, the Stata way becomes</p>
<pre><code>
regress y i.x1#c.x2
</code></pre>
<p>whereas the R way becomes</p>
<pre><code>
lm(y~factor(x1):x2)
</code></pre>
<p>That's all.</p>
