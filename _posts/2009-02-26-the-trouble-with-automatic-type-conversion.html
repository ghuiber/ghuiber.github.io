<p>Lately I have been writing a lot of modular Stata code, where bits and pieces of the job are done by separate programs, sometimes declared in different do-files (called in with <code>do</code>). You get programs to pass on things to each other by making them <code>rclass</code>. Now, r() results can be scalars as in <a href="http://enoriver.net/index.php/2009/01/09/gems-from-the-users-guide/">this example</a>, or locals. The latter are convenient because they can accommodate strings as easily as numbers, but they can trip you up.</p>
<p>See, Stata locals are just strings that come with a reasonable kind of automatic type conversion designed to make your life easier: if your string consists of numbers only, it will be evaluated. For example, <code>local a=1</code> and <code>local a 1</code> have the same effect: <code>display `a'</code> will return 1, the number, in either case.</p>
<p>But there is a subtle difference between an empty local with a name and a missing local. Stata, in a pinch, will identify either as a missing value, and that may work for you most of the time. But only the former can be called in a numeric expression that relies on automatic type conversion. The latter will give you a "missing name" error. Below is a simple example:<br />
<code><br />
capture prog drop myLocal<br />
prog def myLocal, rclass<br />
</code><code><br />
local a<br />
return local myresult `a'<br />
</code><code><br />
end<br />
</code><code><br />
myLocal<br />
local a `r(myresult)' // note (1): this will work fine<br />
</code><code><br />
if `a'==. {<br />
  di "local a is missing"<br />
}<br />
else {<br />
  di `a'<br />
}<br />
</code><br />
The code above will abort with the error message <code>"nothing found where name expected r(198);"</code>, but that error message won't come at the definition of <code>local a</code> commented with note (1). That definition will work as if everything were fine: it simply returns a missing value. It's when you're calling the subsequent if-condition that you run into trouble.</p>
<p>The solution is to make sure that myLocal is returning what you mean it to. If you want it to return a missing numeric value, this is the way to go:<br />
<code><br />
capture prog drop myLocal<br />
prog def myLocal, rclass<br />
</code><code><br />
local a=.<br />
return local myresult `a'<br />
</code><code><br />
end<br />
</code><code><br />
myLocal<br />
local a `r(myresult)'<br />
</code><code><br />
if `a'==. {<br />
  di "local a is missing"<br />
}<br />
else {<br />
  di `a'<br />
}<br />
</code><br />
If instead you want to return a missing string, you need to make sure that your if-condition is a string condition:<br />
<code><br />
capture prog drop myLocal<br />
prog def myLocal, rclass<br />
</code><code><br />
local a<br />
return local myresult `a'<br />
</code><code><br />
end<br />
</code><code><br />
myLocal<br />
local a `r(myresult)'<br />
</code><code><br />
if "`a'"=="" {<br />
  di "local a is missing"<br />
}<br />
else {<br />
  di `a'<br />
}<br />
</code><br />
This is not as pointless as it looks. You seldom want programs to return a missing value as a result, of course. But a missing value can sometimes be a legitimate member of the set of possible results. When you run into one, you need a way to handle it.</p>
