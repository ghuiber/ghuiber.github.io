<p>On my current project I occasionally have to report anomalies in input data to people upstream, who can look into them. I do this with html files which I knit from <a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/">R Markdown</a>. They have to include prose, code, results, and pictures. As I edit them on my way to the final product, it's practical to cache some of the code chunks, especially if they require loading large input files or reading from a database.</p>
<p>The cache folders can get quite big. If it so happens that I haven't edited <code>.gitignore</code> to skip cache folders, my next commit will be slow and the Sync will fail because the enterprise GitHub server has a 50M file size limit.</p>
<p>But if you've already hit 'commit' and the Sync button in the GitHub app, what do you do? It turns out you can edit <code>.gitignore</code> so it knows better next time, maybe delete the offending files -- not that you strictly have to, but these cache folders won't be needed once the report is in its final format and they just take up disk space -- and then do this at the command line:</p>
<pre><code>git status
git add --all
git commit --amend --no-edit
git status
</code></pre>
<p>The first <code>git status</code> will show that you have deleted files and modified <code>.gitignore</code>. The <code>git add --all</code> construct, unlike <code>git add .</code>, will stage the deletions as well as the modification. Then <code>git commit --amend --no-edit</code> is a brand new commit on top of the old one, as explained <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/rewriting-history/git-commit--amend/">here</a>. The second <code>git status</code> confirms that all is well, which you can see again when you switch back to the GitHub app: the Sync button tells you that you're ahead by one commit, you click it, and the push is quick, because the huge cache files are gone.</p>
