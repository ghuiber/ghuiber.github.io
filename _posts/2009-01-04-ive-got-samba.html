<p>I finally got around to configuring the Samba server on the FreeBSD machine. The instructions are <a href="http://www.nostarch.com/freebsdserver.htm">here</a>Â and they couldn't be clearer. One thing didn't work the way the book described it, not big enough to be worth investigating. That's the syntax of Samba commands. Rather than<br />
<code><br />
# smbpasswd -a <em>username</em><br />
</code><br />
I had to do<br />
<code><br />
# /usr/local/bin/smbpasswd -a <em>username</em><br />
</code><br />
But other than that, the thing was a breeze. Buy the book if you're thinking of building a server with FreeBSD. It's well worth the price.</p>
