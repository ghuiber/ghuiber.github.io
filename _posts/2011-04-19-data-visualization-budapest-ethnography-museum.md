Big circles designate villages that sent goods to the market. Small circles designate other villages. Double lines mean postal roads, single lines mean other public roads. The symbols on the list mean (in this order): cattle, pigs, poultry, grains (autumn, spring), bread, fruit, melons, cabbage, root vegetables, butter, wood, hay.

If anybody reading this ever goes to the Budapest Ethnography Museum, runs across this poster, and takes a better picture, I would be grateful for a copy. My cell phone photography skills are nothing to brag about.
