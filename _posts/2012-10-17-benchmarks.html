<p>I went googling for some examples of quadratic programming done in Mata, and stumbled across a fairly recent Statalist discussion. The original question is <a href="http://www.stata.com/statalist/archive/2012-07/msg00707.html">here</a> and the official response, typically prompt, is <a href="http://www.stata.com/statalist/archive/2012-07/msg00749.html">here</a>. I tested Patrick Roland's code on my own machine (2011 MacBook Pro Core2 i5) but with <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/">Octave</a> instead of MATLAB, and with R in addition. Octave took about 2 seconds. My R code is </p>
<pre><code>
system.time(chol2inv(matrix(rnorm(2000^2),2000,2000)))
</code></pre>
<p>This took about 4 seconds to run, whether in RStudio or in command-line R 2.15.1. Mata, meanwhile, still takes about 30 seconds. I run Stata 12MP, all up to date. I'd be curious how SAS/IML does. I don't have it.</p>
