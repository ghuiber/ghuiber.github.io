<p>If you run a virtual Linux machine as a VMware appliance, and you have VMWare Tools installed, you can let it write to folders accessible from the Windows host. This takes two steps.</p>
<p>First, in VMware Player (as of 3.0) you edit the virtual machine settings -- enable Shared Folders in the Options tab, and add a host path there -- say C:\data\share_with_vm. You can add several distinct Windows paths here. </p>
<p>Next, you add this line to /etc/rc.local right before the "exit 0" line:<br />
<code>
<pre>
mount -t vmhgfs .host:/ /home/user/Shares
</pre>
<p></code><br />
Your Linux virtual computer will see any of the Windows folders you shared at the first step as children of the ~/Shares directory. Adding this line to /etc/rc.local makes Shares available to you as soon as you start the VM.</p>
<p>This is how I do Linux on my work computer now, after I first tried Cygwin, then had a dual-boot setup for a while.</p>
