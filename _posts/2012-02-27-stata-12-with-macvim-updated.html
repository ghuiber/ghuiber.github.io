<p>A while back I <a href="http://enoriver.net/index.php/2011/09/14/stata-12-with-macvim/" title="Stata 12 with MacVim">showed</a> how to get <a href="http://www.stata.com">Stata 12</a> to work with <a href="http://code.google.com/p/macvim/">MacVim</a>. This is to let you know about a bug fix. I posted the details on the <a href="http://www.stata.com/statalist/">Statalist</a> just now. If you're reading this blog and you're not also a Statalist subscriber, you may want to change that.</p>
