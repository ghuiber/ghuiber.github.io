<p>Last week I mentioned that in the course of switching from Notepad++ to Vim I lost the ability to run Stata do-files or selected lines from within the text editor, and I asked my readers for help if they had a solution. What do you know, one of them did, and wrote to me all the way from China with a Vim script that solves both problems. I won't repeat it here because it is almost identical to <a href="http://www.stata.com/statalist/archive/2006-06/msg00905.html">this one</a>. Clearly, I need to remember to always look into the Statalist archive first. </p>
<p>There was one line that I had to change, where Vim is ordered to clean up after itself. Every time you runDoLines() you produce a bunch of .tmp.do files in your %temp% directory, which Vim knows as $TEMP. Though this<br />
<code>
<pre>
au VimLeave * exe "!del -y " temp
</pre>
<p></code><br />
should have deleted them, on my computer it did not. This one did:<br />
<code>
<pre>
au VimLeave * silent exe '!del /Q "'.$TEMP.'\*.tmp.do"'
</pre>
<p></code><br />
Another thing I tinkered with was the way Vim handles these backup files that end in a tilde. You can disable them entirely, by adding<br />
<code>
<pre>
set nobackup nowritebackup
</pre>
<p></code><br />
to _vimrc as explained <a href="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/editor-faq/vim/">here</a>. You can also have Vim keep them somewhere you can delete them explicitly, in bulk, as explained <a href="http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/vimfaq2html3.pl#7.2">here</a>. Finally, you can use a combination of both: you save backup files while Vim is working, but then you make it delete them all when it starts next time. That is explained <a href="http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Remove_swap_and_backup_files_from_your_working_directory">here</a>. I went with it, so after I created a temp folder in $VIMRUNTIME, I added this to my _vimrc file:<br />
<code>
<pre>
" Keeps backups in $VIMRUNTIME\temp folder, cleans them up
silent execute '!mkdir "'.$VIMRUNTIME.'\temp"'
silent execute '!del /Q "'.$VIMRUNTIME.'\temp\*~"'
set backupdir=$VIMRUNTIME\temp\
set directory=$VIMRUNTIME\temp\
</pre>
<p></code><br />
In the process of figuring this out, I also discovered that there's a quick way to clean up %temp% thoroughly, as shown <a href="http://www.css-networks.com/2008/08/how-to-clear-the-temp-directory.html">here</a>. Good to know. One of these days I might add that to _vimrc too. Now I'm on a roll.</p>
