<p>This will be a short post, just to keep me in the habit. </p>
<p>I found two new blogs I want you to know about: <a href="http://normaldeviate.wordpress.com/">Normal Deviate</a> and <a href="http://www.econometricsbysimulation.com/">Econometrics by Simulation</a>.</p>
<p>The week after next <a href="http://polmeth.web.unc.edu/">PolMeth XXIX</a> is in town and <a href="http://gking.harvard.edu/">Gary King</a> is speaking on Friday, July 20, talking about robust standard errors. I'm going.</p>
<p>I booked my spot at <a href="http://stata.com/meeting/sandiego12/">Stata Conference 2012</a> and I have a stack of books in mind for the participant discount.</p>
<p>I finished the <a href="http://www.stata.com/bookstore/workflow-data-analysis-stata/">Workflow</a> book. Chapter 5 will change my life, I can tell.</p>
<p>Anybody writing the book version of the <a href="http://www.stata.com/meeting/chicago11/materials/chi11_gould.pdf">Mata Missing Manual</a> yet? I volunteer to read galley proofs, test code.</p>
