<p>Of course if you are on the Statalist you already know. Details <a href="http://www.stata.com/stata11/">here</a>. New features include a proper editor with syntax highlighting, full pdf documentation, support for interaction terms typed directly in your estimation expression -- the lack of which used to be a reason to prefer <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a> -- and a full kit of object-oriented features in Mata.</p>
<p>Stata 10 may well be my last Stata license under Windows.</p>
