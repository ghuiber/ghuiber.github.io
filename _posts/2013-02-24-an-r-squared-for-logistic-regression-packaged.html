<p>This morning I checked Paul Allison's Statistical Horizons blog and found <a href="http://www.statisticalhorizons.com/r2logistic">a post on [latex]R^2[/latex] measures for logistic regression</a>. It introduced me to Tjur's $latex R^2 $ by way of an example, which I repackaged below:</p>
<pre><code>
// Reference: http://www.statisticalhorizons.com/r2logistic

// program definition
capture prog drop tjur2
program tjur2, rclass

if !inlist(e(cmd),"logit","logistic") {
   di as err "Tjur's R-squared only works after logit or logistic."
   exit 498 // Thank you, Nick Cox.
}
tempname yhat
predict `yhat' if e(sample)
local y `e(depvar)'
quietly ttest `yhat', by(`y')
local r2logistic r(mu_2)-r(mu_1)
di "Tjur's R-squared " _col(20) %4.3f `r2logistic'
return local r2logistic `r2logistic'

end

// use case
use "http://www.uam.es/personal_pdi/economicas/rsmanga/docs/mroz.dta", clear
logistic inlf kidslt6 age educ huswage city exper
tjur2
</code></pre>
<p>I'm not sure yet if it's worth saving this program as <code>ado/personal/t/tjur2.ado</code> for my future logistic regression diagnostic needs, but I haven't posted anything Stata-related in too long, so there you have it.</p>
