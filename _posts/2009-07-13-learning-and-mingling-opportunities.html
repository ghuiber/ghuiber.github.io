<p>If you've got Â£900 to spare and an inclination to spend a lovely September week at the London School of Tropical Medicine, <a href="http://www.stata.com/news/advancedstata09.html">lucky you</a>.</p>
<p>I'd appreciate a first-hand account if you go. StataCorp <a href="http://www.stata.com/netcourse/">does what it can</a>, but I'm sure <a href="http://www.stata.com/meeting/shortcourse.html">the more the merrier</a>. My own first attempt at contributing happened this May, when I spent five hours at <a href="http://www.scigames.com/">a client</a> of a client, witnessing to a small bunch of mathematicians, very nice people.</p>
<p>I liked it, and I'd love to do it again. So I thought I'd put it out there. If you know anybody in the Durham, NC area who is Stata-deprived and has the good judgment to recognize the condition, I'd welcome an introduction.</p>
<p>Anybody going to DC <a href="http://www.stata.com/meeting/dcconf09/">at the end of the month</a>? The block of rooms at the Monaco is sold out, but the Grand Hyatt, just a few blocks over, gave me a great rate. Book it through Expedia; they'll give you a $50 prepaid MasterCard.</p>
