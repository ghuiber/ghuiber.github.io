title: Smoked turkey, take two
---

## What changed since [last time](http://www.enoriver.net/2015/11/26/i-smoked-a-turkey/)

 * smaller bird: 9lb Lil' Butterball
 * added paprika to the brine, 1/2 tsp
 * subtracted thyme, sage, and celery
 * lowered temperature to about 250&deg; 
 * using cheaper additive-free 100% hardwood briquets instead of lump charcoal
 * did not oil the skin
 * did not clip the wing tips (never did anything with last year's) 
 * brined the neck along with the rest of the bird and stuffed it into the cavity.

## Notes

Temperature stabilized at 260&deg; before I put the turkey on. After 2 hours and 30 minutes juices run clear from the thickest part of the breast meat, where I stuck the probe, but the internal temperature is just a little above 140&deg;. Un-oiled skin picked up quite a bit of smoke tint, and I assume flavor along with it, but it has a matte appearance and I don't think it will be crispy.

Three hours and 20 minutes later internal temperature still not up to 165&deg;, but it has been holding at 160&deg; for some 10 minutes now and there are no more juices when I stab the thick part of the breast. I may have overcooked this bird already, so it's coming off the fire. The grill gauge still reads 260&deg; and this whole thing took about half a chimney's worth of charcoal.
