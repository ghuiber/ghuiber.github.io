<p>The user-written commands you download to your ado/plus directory are updated once in a while on that RepEc server they come from. So, after you <code>findit</code> and then <code>net install</code> it, your imported command might need to be refreshed occasionally. That is what <code>adoupdate, update</code> does.</p>
<p>I was reminded of this when I tried to run <code>freduse</code> today. Actually, the problem that reminded me of it -- a "not found" error message thrown when the command invoked the Mata function  _fredifinparse() -- didn't go away, but "adoupdate, update" is still a good thing to do. What did fix _fredifinparse() is described <a href="http://vhaguiar.wordpress.com/2010/02/07/stata-tip-importing-stock-info-from-yahoo-finance-and-fed-macroeconomic-data/">here</a>.</p>
