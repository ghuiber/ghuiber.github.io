<p>When I upgraded my WordPress install, all my quotes started getting matched -- the marks tilted downward on the left side, and upward on the right. That is the WordPress default behavior and it's called "texturize". I guess if your blog is your piece of fancy stationery you like your quotes that way. But I post code, in monospace type. My quotes must be raw and unfiltered, the way they look on a terminal window. And I can't remember what I did when I installed WordPress in the first place to turn that matching quote business off, but it worked.</p>
<p>Alright: do you have any idea what Google turns up when you try "matching quotes", "double quotes" or "WordPress matching quotes" as search terms? A lot of junk. In the English language "quote" means citation and price estimate among other things. I guess that's what "texturize" is supposed to prevent, but who's going to remember that word and, more importantly, who's going to remember what it means in this specific context? Well, I'm posting this so my quote troubles may be finally over.</p>
<p>On my next upgrade I will do what I did just now: I will re-activate my copy of Jason Litka's "Disable wptexturize" plugin. The original description of how it works is on <a href="http://www.jasonlitka.com/2007/09/25/wordpress-plugin-disable-wptexturize/">Jason's blog</a>. If you were looking for the same thing and Google sent you here, go there.</p>
<p>Thank you, Jason.</p>
