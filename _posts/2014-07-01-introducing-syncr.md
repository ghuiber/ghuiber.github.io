title: Introducing syncR
---

A new and improved version of the [syncPacks()](http://rpubs.com/ghuiber/syncR) function is now part of a  GitHub package, which you can install through `devtools::install_github('ghuiber/syncR')`. If you're into that, you can help develop it further too.

Thanks go to Hilary Parker for her [thorough instructions](http://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/) and to Hadley Wickham for [devtools](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/) and [roxygen2](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/).
