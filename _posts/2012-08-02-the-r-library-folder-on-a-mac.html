<p>How do you update your R? I mean the whole thing, not just the base packages.</p>
<p>R comes with a library folder where packages go -- both the base packages and the user-written ones you install over time. I'm not entirely sure what would be the best place for this folder so updates to all packages are as easy as possible. </p>
<p>It gets worse. On a Mac you have not one, but n+2 library folders. One is /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/library. Let's call it (1). The other n+1 are as many as there are historic versions of R on your computer, plus one. All are in /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/. In my case, they are as follows: n of them are in X/Resources/library, where X is 2.13, 2.14, and 2.15; one is in Current/Resources/library. </p>
<p>I know that the three library folders in X=2.15, Current and (1) are identical and updated simultaneously, though only the first shows up when I call <code>.libPaths()</code>. But when you update say, from 2.15 to 2.16, your historic versions remain frozen and the new (1) and Current folders reflect only 2.16. You have to install non-base packages all over again, by hand. Or do you? Is there a way to script an update of everything in the library folder at version t-1 when you update your R to version t? If anybody knows, please drop a comment. Thank you.</p>
