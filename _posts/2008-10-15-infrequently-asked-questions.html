<p>Some of the things I do with Stata are so rare that I always forget how I'd done them before. So, they turn into questions and they're infrequent. Â </p>
<p>1. Turn a string variable into more variables, one for each word of the longest string:</p>
<p><code>split mystringvar, gen(stub)</code></p>
<p>2. Collect the levels of a categorical string variable into a list:</p>
<p><code>levelsof mycatvar, local(levels)</code></p>
<p>3. Check that two lists are logically identical (same items, not necessarily in the same order):</p>
<p><code>local foo: list clean thislist<br />
local bar: list clean thatlist<br />
local test: list foo===bar // `test' returns either 0 or 1</code></p>
<p>Notice the three equal signs. That's not a typo. Two equal signs check for strict identity (i.e., the order of the items in the two lists matters).</p>
<p>You care to add to the list?</p>
