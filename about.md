### Eno River

The Eno flows through Durham and it's pretty. This blog has nothing to do with either the [park](http://www.ncparks.gov/Visit/parks/enri/main.php) or the [conservancy](http://www.enoriver.org) though you should definitely hike in the former and give some money to the latter.

Back in 2007, freshly laid off, I started doing freelance statistical work. That paid the bills until 2010. I called my shop Eno River Analytics -- reasoning that if the Charles was good enough for [these guys](http://www.charlesriverassociates.com), the Eno would suit me fine -- and I claimed this domain because it was available.

I could have picked a better name. I speak with an accent. When I say "Eno River Analytics" people tend to hear "in a river analytics" and are rightly confused.
